# Mnist_Flask_WatsonAssistant
This repository integrate the fundamentals of Mnist (CNN), Flask and Watson Assistant

Application: Chatbot that classify hardwritten digits using Keras for training and inference, Flask as service and Watson Assistant as cognitive motor

## Prerequisites

* tensorflow==1.13.1
* numpy==1.16.2
* Flask==1.0.3
* Keras==2.2.4
* Pillow==6.2.0
* Jupyter-notebook

## Project Structure

1. mnistTrain.ipynb: This script contains the procedure for the train of the convolutional neural networks (MNIST) using keras
2. predict_flask.ipynb: This contains the Flask APIs to deploy the prediction on Watson Assistant for the recognition of hardwritten digits. 
3. templates: This folder contains the HTML template to allow user to upload the image and displays the predicted intent.

## Running the project

1. Clone intent classification project in a local directory.

git clone https://github.com/jjguajo/Mnist_Flask_WatsonAssistant
